# HTML & CSS Basics

## HTML: HyperText Markup Language

- Used to structure content on a web page (images, text, forms etc)
- We structure content using **HTML tags**

```html
<p> content </p>
<a> link </a>
<img>
```

`<strong>`: make the text bold indicating that it's important
`<small>`: make the text smaller
`<em>`: make the text italic

There are 6 different sizes of heading tags

`tagName + tab` populates HTML tag directly.

`<ul>`: unordered list is a wrapper for `<li>` tags with symbols.
`<ol>`: ordered list is a wrapper with numbers.

`<div>` is used to divide contents into different sections or group together relevant contents which belong together. `<div>` has no visual difference but it comes handy when we work with CSS.

`<span>`: used to add CSS or JS hooks to text of HTML.

`<br>`: linebreak (no closing tag needed since no content inside it)
`<hr>`: horizontal ruler (Equivalent to `<hr />`)

`<img src="image_path", alt="text representation of image for accessibility">`

`<a href="">`: href is hyperlink reference

`<blockquote cite="source">`

`<p style="">`: style attributes in `<p>` can be used for text styling 




## CSS: Cascading Style Sheets

- Works alongside with HTML
- Used to style web pages to make them look better
- Change colours, position, effects, font sizes etc
